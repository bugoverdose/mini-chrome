      <p>
        I started this project because I wanted to have a little taste of what
        building a multi-process application is like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to building a website or a backend application, I felt more
        powerful as I gained so much control over the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stopped working on it because I've already learned enough from this
        project. I could add more UI and functionalities, but that would just be
        copy/pasting the code I've already wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we all know that
        <em>no one's actually going to be using this app</em>.
